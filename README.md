# Igoofil 
Simple Bash script for searching subdomains and their IP addresses from an "index.html" file which resides as a homepage of a specific domain. For example, the "index.html" file of the website "www.megacorpone.com".<br>

For now, this script supports IPV4 only (Internet is still on IPV4, but will soon shift to IPV6).<br> 
Stay tuned for Python and IPV6 support.
